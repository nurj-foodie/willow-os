# Terms of Service 🌿

**Last Updated: December 21, 2025**

By using Willow OS, you agree to these simple terms.

## 1. Usage
Willow OS is a personal productivity tool. You agree not to use it for any illegal activities or to attempt to breach our security.

## 2. Willow Ledger (Finance)
The Willow Ledger is a mindful spending tracker. 
- It is NOT a financial advisory service.
- The data is entered manually by you.
- We are not responsible for any financial decisions or losses resulting from the use of the app.

## 3. Data Syncing
We use cloud syncing to keep your vibe consistent across devices. While we strive for 100% uptime, Willow is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind.

## 4. Account Security
You are responsible for keeping your email access and Passkeys secure. We will never ask for your password (because we don't have one!).

## 5. Changes to Terms
We may update these terms as Willow grows. Continued use of the app signifies your acceptance of new terms.
