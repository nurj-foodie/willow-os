# Willow 🌿

A soft-productivity web app designed for the "Gen Z" aesthetic. "Flow, don't force."

## 🚀 Overview
Willow is a minimal, low-anxiety task manager that replaces rigid calendars with a fluid vertical list of "Liquid Blocks." It focuses on "main character energy" and romanticizing productivity.

## ✨ Core Features
- **Liquid Stream:** Vertical drag-and-drop tasks with bouncy physics.
- **Smart NLP Input:** Type naturally (e.g., "Gym at 5pm") and let Willow extract the time.
- **Aesthetic First:** Oat milk backgrounds, matcha accents, and serif typography.
- **Reset Ritual:** A comforting end-of-day process to rollover unfinished work.
