# Willow 🌿

A soft-productivity web app designed for the "Gen Z" aesthetic. "Flow, don't force."

## 🚀 Overview
Willow is a minimal, low-anxiety task manager that replaces rigid calendars with a fluid vertical list of "Liquid Blocks." It focuses on "main character energy" and romanticizing productivity.

## ✨ Core Features
- **Liquid Stream:** Vertical drag-and-drop tasks with bouncy physics.
- **Smart NLP Input:** Type naturally (e.g., "Gym tomorrow at 5pm") and let Willow extract the time and date.
- **Interactive Calendar:** Monthly calendar view with task indicators and date-based filtering.
- **Task Management:** Edit tasks inline, delete with confirmation, and smart date assignment.
- **Eisenhower Matrix:** Prioritize tasks with color-coded themes (Clay, Sage, Matcha, Lavender).
- **Personalized Rituals:** Time-aware greetings, atmospheric background shifts, and a "Hold to Enter" focus moment.
- **Permanent Archive:** A "Wrap Up" ritual that moves completed tasks to a searchable history drawer.
- **Receipt Scanner:** AI-powered receipt scanning with Gemini 2.0 Flash for instant ledger entries.
- **Profile Command Center:** A unified glassmorphism modal for settings, notifications, and identity management.
- **Instant Demo Mode:** 🎭 Try the app immediately with zero-config localStorage persistence.
