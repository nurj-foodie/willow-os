# Willow 🌿

A soft-productivity web app designed for the "Gen Z" aesthetic. "Flow, don't force."

## 🚀 Overview
Willow is a minimal, low-anxiety task manager that replaces rigid calendars with a fluid vertical list of "Liquid Blocks." It focuses on "main character energy" and romanticizing productivity.

## ✨ Core Features
- **Liquid Stream:** Vertical drag-and-drop tasks with bouncy physics.
- **Smart NLP Input:** Type naturally (e.g., "Gym at 5pm") and let Willow extract the time.
- **Eisenhower Matrix:** Prioritize tasks with color-coded "dots" (Clay, Sage, Matcha, Lavender).
- **Personalized Rituals:** Time-aware greetings, atmospheric background shifts, and a "Hold to Enter" focus moment.
- **Permanent Archive:** A "Wrap Up" ritual that moves completed tasks to a searchable history drawer.
- **Instant Demo Mode:** 🎭 Try the app immediately with zero-config localStorage persistence.
